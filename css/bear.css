/*
Take advantage of media queries using max-width for desktop down and min-width for mobile up designs. Also utilize positioning: absolute, as well as properties such as top:, left:, right: ,bottom: to set the animals' positioning. You can also use CSS transform: rotate() if you wish to turn the animals. A single media query should be used to solve each page.
Write the media queries necessary in the css files for each corresponding animal:
For the bear, when sizing the browser from smaller to larger (mobile up), when the screen reaches 1196px stop him from falling off the cliff by setting him to stay 800px from the left side of the screen before he reaches the edge.
