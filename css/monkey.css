For the monkey, use a combination of min-width and max-width to 
set a media query that will allow the Monkey to jump up over the 
Spice Girls from screen size of 406px to 1090px keeping him safe 
from their affection.*/

@media all and (min-width: 406px) and (max-width: 1090px) { 
  #monkey {
    top: -60px;
